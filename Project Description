Project Title - HR Analytics Dashboard Project
Overview:
The HR Analytics Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of workforce dynamics, with a strong focus on employee attrition analysis across various demographics and job roles. Built using Power BI, this dashboard enables HR leadership to identify key trends, potential risk areas, and strategic opportunities to improve retention, optimize hiring, and enhance workforce planning.

Key Highlights:
Total Employees: 1,470

Total Attrition: 237 employees

Attrition Rate: 16.1%

Average Employee Age: 37 years

Average Salary: $6,500

Average Years at Company: 7 years

Insights:
1. Attrition by Education:
Employees with a Life Sciences background account for the highest attrition at 38%, followed by Medical (27%) and Marketing (15%).

Lesser attrition observed in employees from Human Resources (3%) and Other (5%) educational backgrounds.

2. Attrition by Age:
Highest attrition is concentrated in the 26-35 years age group (116 employees).

Younger employees (18-25 years) and mid-career employees (36-45 years) show almost equal attrition (~44 and 43 employees respectively).

Attrition significantly drops for employees aged 55+ (only 8 employees).

3. Attrition by Gender:
Male attrition (140 employees) is notably higher than female attrition (79 employees).

This suggests potential opportunities to address gender-specific retention strategies.

4. Attrition by Salary Slab:
Employees earning up to $5k have the highest attrition (163 employees).

Attrition decreases significantly in higher salary brackets, with only 5 employees leaving in the $15k+ range.

Indicates a strong correlation between lower salary brackets and higher attrition rates.

5. Attrition by Years at Company:
Maximum attrition occurs within the first year (59 employees), showing a common early-exit trend.

Employees with 5-7 years of experience show relatively low attrition, suggesting improved loyalty beyond the early stages.

A smaller spike is observed around 10 years of service, which could signal mid-career reassessment.

6. Attrition by Job Role:
Laboratory Technicians and Sales Executives show the highest attrition (62 and 57 employees respectively).

Research Scientists also report significant attrition (47 employees).

Targeted interventions in these job roles could greatly impact overall attrition rates.

7. Attrition Distribution Across Departments:
The dashboard includes filters for Human Resources, Research & Development, and Sales, allowing department-specific insights to be easily accessed and compared.

Business Implications:
Retention Strategies: Focus on high-risk segments such as young professionals (26â€“35 years), lower salary bands (up to $5k), and specific high-attrition job roles.

Compensation Review: Review and potentially enhance salary structures for junior employees to reduce early attrition.

Career Development Programs: Design career growth paths for employees within the first 1-2 years to improve engagement and reduce early exits.

Diversity and Inclusion: Investigate reasons behind gender-based attrition differences and implement gender-specific retention initiatives.

Job Role Analysis: Deep dive into job roles like Laboratory Technicians and Sales Executives to understand challenges and enhance role satisfaction.

Conclusion:
This HR Analytics Dashboard equips leadership with actionable insights to strengthen employee retention, optimize talent management strategies, and support evidence-based decision-making. By addressing the key factors identified, the organization can significantly reduce attrition, improve employee satisfaction, and drive sustainable workforce growth.
